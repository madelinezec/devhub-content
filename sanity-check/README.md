# Sanity Check

## What is it?

This small python script scans the blog posts: 
- tags,
- products,
- languages,
- unused images from the `source/images/` folder,
- images used but not found in the `source/images/` folder,
- missing information in twitter directive:
  - site,
  - creator (with the @),
  - title (max size 70 characters),
  - image (with a relative path and image in the /images/ folder),
  - image-alt,
  - description (max size 160 characters),
- missing in the og directive:
  - url,
  - title (max size 95 characters),
  - image,
  - type,
  - description (max size 200 characters),
- meta-description (max size 155 characters),
- type,
- level,
- "include" directives with non existing content,
- "atf-image" directive presence
- links with the correct number of underscores,
- check "home" and "learn" featured pages are in snooty.toml,
- check all the blog posts in snooty.toml exist.

## Use it

Place your shell in the `sanity-check` folder.
```bash
python3 sanity-check.py
```

## Errors

The scripts tells you something like this?

```
ERROR: invalid element in directive '.. tags::' in file: ../source/article/top-4-reasons-to-use-mongodb.txt => 'SQL'
```

That's probably because you forgot the star `*` to make a list under the appropriate directive in this file.

### Do

```
.. products::

   * Stitch
   * Atlas
```

### Don't

```
.. products::

   Stitch
   Atlas
```
