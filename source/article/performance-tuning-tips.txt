MongoDB Performance Tuning Questions
====================================

.. introduction::

   Most of the challenges related to keeping a MongoDB cluster running at
   top speed can be addressed by asking a small number of fundamental
   questions and then using a few crucial metrics to answer them.

   By keeping an eye on the metrics related to query performance, database
   performance, throughput, resource utilization, resource saturation, and
   other critical "assertion" errors it's possible to find problems that
   may be lurking in your cluster. Early detection allows you to stay ahead
   of the game, resolving issues before they affect performance.

   These fundamental questions apply no matter how MongoDB is used, whether
   through `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__, the managed service available on all major cloud
   providers, or through MongoDB Community or Enterprise editions, which
   are run in a self-managed manner on-premise or in the cloud.

   Each type of MongoDB deployment can be used to support databases at
   scale with immense transaction volumes and that means performance tuning
   should be a constant activity.

   But the good news is that the same metrics are used in the tuning
   process no matter how MongoDB is used.

   However, as we'll see, the tuning process is much easier in the cloud
   using `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ where everything is more automatic and
   prefabricated.

   Here are the key questions you should always be asking about MongoDB
   performance tuning and the metrics that can answer them.

   Are all queries running at top speed?
   -------------------------------------

   Query problems are perhaps the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to
   debugging MongoDB performance issues. Finding problems and fixing them
   is generally straightforward. This section covers the metrics that can
   reveal query performance problems and what to do if you find slow
   queries.

   **Slow Query Log.** The time elapsed and the method used to execute each
   query is captured in MongoDB log files, which can be searched for slow
   queries. In addition, queries over a certain threshold can be logged
   explicitly by the `MongoDB Database
   Profiler <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`__.

   -  When a query is slow, first look to see if it was a `collection scan
      rather than an index scan <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/explain-results/#collection-scan-vs-index-use>`__.

      -  Collection scans means all documents in a collection must be read.
      -  Index scans limit the number of documents that must be inspected.

   -  `Consider adding an index when you see a lot of collection
      scans <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/analyze-query-plan/>`__.
   -  But remember: indexes have a cost when it comes to writes and
      updates. Too many indexes that are underutilized can slow down the
      modification or insertion of new documents. Depending on the nature
      of your workloads, this may or may not be a problem.

   **Scanned vs Returned** is a metric that `can be found in Cloud
   Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/check-your-query-and-index-performance-with-the#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScanned%2Freturned%E2%80%9D%20refers%20to,for%20MongoDB%202.4%20and%20newer.>`__
   and in `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ that indicates how many documents had to be scanned
   in order to return the documents meeting the query.

   -  In the absence of indexes, a rarely met ideal for this ratio is 1/1,
      meaning all documents scanned were returned — no wasted scans. Most
      of the time however, when scanning is done, documents are scanned
      that are not returned meaning the ratio is greater than 1.
   -  When indexes are used, this ratio can be less than 1 or even 0,
      meaning you have a `covered
      query <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/query-optimization/#covered-query>`__.
      When no documents needed to be scanned, producing a ratio of 0, that
      means all the data needed was in the index.
   -  Scanning huge amounts of documents is inefficient and could indicate
      problems regarding missing indexes or indicate a need for `query
      optimization <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/query-optimization/>`__.

   **Scan and Order** is an index related metric that can be found in Cloud
   Manager and `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__.

   -  A high Scan and Order number, say 20 or more, indicates that the
      server is having to sort query results to get them in the right
      order. This takes time and increases the memory load on the server.
   -  Fix this by making sure indexes are sorted in the order in which the
      queries need the documents, or by adding missing indexes.

   **WiredTiger Ticket Number** is a key indicator of the performance of
   the `WiredTiger <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/wiredtiger/>`__
   storage engine, which, since release 3.2, has been the storage engine
   for MongoDB.

   -  WiredTiger has a concept of read or write tickets that are created
      when the database is accessed. The WiredTiger ticket number should
      always be at 128.
   -  If the value goes below 128 and stays below that number, that means
      the server is waiting on something and it's an indication of a
      problem.
   -  The remedy is then to find the operations that are going too slowly
      and start a debugging process.
   -  Deployments of MongoDB using releases older than 3.2 will certainly
      get a performance boost from migrating to a later version that uses
      WiredTiger.

   **Document Structure Antipatterns** aren't revealed by a metric but can
   be something to look for when debugging slow queries. Here are two of
   the most notorious bad practices that hurt performance.

   **Unbounded arrays:** In a MongoDB document, if an array can grow
   without a size limit, it could cause a performance problem because every
   time you update the array, MongoDB has to rewrite the array into the
   document. If the array is huge, this can cause a performance problem.
   Learn more at `Avoid Unbounded
   Arrays <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/schema-advisor/avoid-unbounded-arrays/>`__
   and `Performance Best Practices: Query Patterns and
   Profiling <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/performance-best-practices-query-patterns-and-profiling>`__.

   **Subdocuments without bounds:** The same thing can happen with respect
   to subdocuments. MongoDB supports inserting documents within documents,
   with up to 128 levels of nesting. Each MongoDB document, including
   subdocuments, also has a size limit of 16MB. If the number of
   subdocuments becomes excessive, performance problems may result.

   One common fix to this problem is to move some or all of the
   subdocuments to a separate collection and then refer to them from the
   original document. You can learn more about this topic in :doc:`this blog post </article/schema-design-anti-pattern-bloated-documents>`.

   Is the database performing at top speed?
   ----------------------------------------

   MongoDB, like most advanced database systems, has thousands of metrics
   that track all aspects of database performance which includes reading,
   writing, and querying the database, as well as making sure background
   maintenance tasks like backups don't gum up the works.

   The metrics described in this section all indicate larger problems that
   can have a variety of causes. Like a warning light on a dashboard, these
   metrics are invaluable high-level indicators that help you start looking
   for the causes before the database has a catastrophic failure.

   .. blockquote::

      Note: Various ways to get access to all of these metrics are covered
      below in the :ref:`getting-access-metrics` section.

   **Replication lag** occurs when a secondary member of a replica set
   falls behind the primary. A detailed examination of the OpLog related
   metrics can help get to the bottom of the problems but the causes are
   often:

   -  A networking issue between the primary and secondary, making nodes
      unreachable
   -  A secondary node applying data slower than the primary node
   -  Insufficient write capacity in which case you should add more shards
   -  Slow operations on the primary node, blocking replication

   **Locking performance** problems are indicated when the number of
   available read or write tickets remaining reaches zero, which means new
   read or write requests will be queued until a new read or write ticket
   is available.

   -  MongoDB's internal locking system is used to support simultaneous
      queries while avoiding write conflicts and inconsistent reads.
   -  Locking performance problems can indicate a variety of problems
      including suboptimal indexes and poor schema design patterns, 
      both of which can lead to locks being held longer than necessary.

   **Number of open cursors rising** without a corresponding growth of
   traffic is often symptomatic of poorly indexed queries or the result of
   long running queries due to large result sets.

   -  This metric can be another indicator that the kind of query
      optimization techniques mentioned in the first section are in order.

   Is the cluster overloaded?
   --------------------------

   A large part of performance tuning is recognizing when your total
   traffic, the throughput of transactions through the system, is rising
   beyond the planned capacity of your cluster. By keeping track of growth
   in throughput, it's possible to expand the capacity in an orderly
   manner. Here are the metrics to keep track of.

   **Read and Write Operations** is the fundamental metric that indicates
   how much work is done by the cluster. The ratio of reads to writes is
   highly dependent on the nature of the workloads running on the cluster.

   -  Monitoring read and write operations over time allows normal ranges
      and thresholds to be established.
   -  As trends in read and write operations show growth in throughput,
      capacity should be gradually increased.

   **Document Metrics** and **Query Executor** are good indications of
   whether the cluster is actually too busy. These metrics can be found in
   Cloud Manager and in `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__. As with read and write operations,
   there is no right or wrong number for these metrics, but having a good
   idea of what's normal helps you discern whether poor performance is
   coming from large workload size or attributable to other reasons.

   -  Document metrics are updated anytime you return a document or insert
      a document. The more documents being returned, inserted, updated or
      deleted, the busier your cluster is.

      -  Poor performance in a cluster that has plenty of capacity usually
         points to query problems.

   -  The query executor tells how many queries are being processed through
      two data points:

      -  Scanned - The average rate per second over the selected sample
         period of index items scanned during queries and query-plan
         evaluation.
      -  Scanned objects - The average rate per second over the selected
         sample period of documents scanned during queries and query-plan
         evaluation.

   **Hardware and Network metrics** can be important indications that
   throughput is rising and will exceed the capacity of computing
   infrastructure. These metrics are gathered from the operating system and
   networking infrastructure. To make these metrics useful for diagnostic
   purposes, you must have a sense of what is normal.

   -  In `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__, or when using Cloud Manager, these metrics are
      easily displayed. If you are running on-premise, it depends on your
      operating system.
   -  There's a lot to track but at a minimum have a baseline range for
      metrics like:

      -  Disk latency
      -  Disk IOPS
      -  Number of Connections

   Is the cluster running out of key resources?
   --------------------------------------------

   A MongoDB cluster makes use of a variety of resources that are provided
   by the underlying computing and networking infrastructure. These can be
   monitored from within MongoDB as well as from outside of MongoDB at the
   level of computing infrastructure as described in the previous section.
   Here are the crucial resources that can be easily tracked from within
   Mongo, especially through Cloud Manager and `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__.

   **Current number of client connections** is usually an effective metric
   to indicate total load on a system. Keeping track of normal ranges at
   various times of the day or week can help quickly identify spikes in
   traffic.

   -  A related metric, percentage of connections used, can indicate when
      MongoDB is getting close to running out of available connections.

   **Storage metrics** track how MongoDB is using persistent storage. In
   the WiredTiger storage engine, each collection is a file and so is each
   index. When a document in a collection is updated, the entire document
   is re-written.

   -  If memory space metrics (dataSize, indexSize, or storageSize) or the
      number of objects show a significant unexpected change while the
      database traffic stays within ordinary ranges, it can indicate a
      problem.
   -  A sudden drop in dataSize may indicate a large amount of data
      deletion, which should be quickly investigated if it was not
      expected.

   **Memory metrics** show how MongoDB is using the virtual memory of the
   computing infrastructure that is hosting the cluster.

   -  An increasing number of page faults or a growing amount of dirty data
      — data changed but not yet written to disk — can indicate problems
      related to the amount of memory available to the cluster.
   -  Cache metrics can help determine if the working set is outgrowing the
      available cache.

   Are critical errors on the rise?
   --------------------------------

   `MongoDB asserts <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/#asserts>`__
   are documents created, almost always because of an
   error, that are captured as part of the MongoDB logging process.

   -  Monitoring the number of asserts created at various levels of
      severity can provide a first level indication of unexpected problems.
      Asserts can be message asserts, the most serious kind, or warning
      assets, regular asserts, and user asserts.
   -  Examining the asserts can provide clues that may lead to the
      discovery of problems.

   .. _getting-access-metrics:

   Getting Access to Metrics and Setting Up Monitoring
   ---------------------------------------------------

   Making use of metrics is far easier if you know the data well: where it
   comes from, how to get at it, and what it means.

   As the MongoDB platform has evolved, it has become far easier to monitor
   clusters and resolve common problems. In addition, the performance
   tuning monitoring and analysis has become increasingly automated. For
   example, `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ through Performance Advisor will now suggest
   adding indexes if it detects a query performance problem.

   But it's best to know the whole story of the data, not just the pretty
   graphs produced at the end.

   Data Sources for MongoDB Metrics
   --------------------------------

   The sources for metrics used to monitor MongoDB are the logs created
   when MongoDB is running and the commands that can be run inside of the
   MongoDB system. These commands produce the detailed statistics that
   describe the state of the system.

   `Monitoring MongoDB performance metrics
   (WiredTiger) <https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-mongodb-performance-metrics-wiredtiger/>`__
   contains an excellent categorization of the metrics available for
   different purposes and the commands that can be used to get them. These
   commands provide a huge amount of detailed information in raw form that
   looks something like the following screenshot:

   .. image:: /images/migration-campaign/wiredtiger-screenshot.png
      :align: center
      :alt: WiredTiger Screenshot

   This information is of high quality but difficult to use.

   Monitoring Environments for MongoDB Metrics
   -------------------------------------------

   As MongoDB has matured as a platform, specialized interfaces have been
   created to bring together the most useful metrics.

   -  `Ops Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager>`__ is a
      management platform for on-premise and private cloud deployments of
      MongoDB that includes extensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.
   -  `Cloud Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager>`__ is a
      management platform for self-managed cloud deployments of MongoDB that
      also includes extensive monitoring and alerting capabilities. (Remember
      this screenshot reflects the user interface at the time of writing.)

   .. image:: /images/migration-campaign/cloud-manager.png
      :align: center
      :alt: MongoDB Cloud Manager

   -  `Real Time Performance
      Panel <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/real-time-performance-panel/index.html>`__,
      part of `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ or MongoDB Ops Manager (requires MongoDB Enterprise
      Advanced subscription), provides graph or table views of dozens of metrics and
      is a great way to keep track of many aspects of performance,
      including most of the metrics discussed earlier.
   -  Commercial products like `New Relic <https://newrelic.com/>`__, `Sumo Logic <https://www.sumologic.com/>`__,
      and `DataDog <https://www.datadoghq.com/>`__ all
      provide interfaces designed for monitoring and alerting on MongoDB
      clusters. A variety of open source platforms such as
      `mtools <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools>`__ can be used as
      well.

   Performance Management Tools for MongoDB Atlas
   ----------------------------------------------

   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ has taken advantage of the standardized APIs and massive
   amounts of data available on cloud platforms to break new ground in
   automating performance tuning. Also, in addition to the `Real Time Performance
   Panel <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/real-time-performance-panel/index.html>`__
   mentioned above, the `Performance
   Advisor <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/performance-advisor/>`__ for
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ analyzes queries that you are actually making on your
   data, determines what's slow and what's not, and makes recommendations
   for when to add indexes that take into account the indexes already in
   use.

   The Professional Services Option
   --------------------------------
