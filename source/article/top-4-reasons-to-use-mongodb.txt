The Top 4 Reasons Why You Should Use MongoDB
============================================
 
.. introduction::

   Welcome (or welcome back!) to the SQL to MongoDB series. In the first
   post in this series, I :doc:`mapped terms and concepts from SQL to MongoDB </article/map-terms-concepts-sql-mongodb>`.

   I also introduced you to Ron. Let’s take a moment and return to Ron. Ron
   is pretty set in his ways. For example, he loves his typewriter. It
   doesn’t matter that computers are a bajillion times more powerful than
   typewriters. Until someone convinces him otherwise, he’s sticking with
   his typewriter.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/typewriter.gif
      :alt: Ron sits at his typewriter and says, "I'm gonna type every word I know."

   Maybe you don’t have a love for typewriters. But perhaps you have a love
   for SQL databases. You’ve been using them for years, you’ve learned how
   to make them work well enough for you, and you know that learning
   MongoDB will require you to change your mindset. Is it really worth the
   effort?

   Yes!

   In this post, we’ll examine the top four reasons why you should use
   MongoDB:

   -  :ref:`sql-mdb-2-scale-cheaper`
   -  :ref:`sql-mdb-2-query-faster`
   -  :ref:`sql-mdb-2-pivot-easier`
   -  :ref:`sql-mdb-2-program-faster`

   .. _sql-mdb-2-scale-cheaper:

   Scale Cheaper
   -------------

   You can scale cheaper with MongoDB. Why?

   Let’s begin by talking about scaling SQL databases. Typically, SQL
   databases scale vertically–when a database becomes too big for its
   server, it is migrated to a larger server.

   .. figure:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/verticalscaling.gif
      :alt: Vertical scaling

      Vertical scaling by migrating to larger servers

   A few key problems arise with vertical scaling: 

   - Large servers tend to
     be more expensive than two smaller servers with the same total capacity.
   - Large servers may not be available due to cost limitations, cloud
     provider limitations, or technology limitations (a server the size you
     need may not exist). 
   - Migrating to a larger server may require
     application downtime.

   When you use MongoDB, you have the flexibility to scale horizontally
   through `sharding <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/>`__.
   Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple servers. When
   your database exceeds the capacity of its current server, you can begin
   sharding and split it over two servers. As your database continues to
   grow, you can continue to add more servers. The advantage is that these
   new servers don’t need to be big, expensive machines–they can be
   cheaper, commodity hardware. Plus, no downtime is required.

      :alt: Horizontal scaling

      Horizonal scaling by adding more commodity servers

   .. _sql-mdb-2-query-faster:

   Query Faster
   ------------

   Your queries will typically be faster with MongoDB. Let’s examine why.

   :ref:`Even in our simple example in the previous post <sql-mdb-1-example-docs>`
   where we modeled Leslie’s data in SQL, we
   saw that her information was spread across three tables. Whenever we
   want to query for Leslie’s information, we’ll need to join three tables
   together.

   In these three small tables, the join will be very fast. However, as the
   tables grow and our queries become more complex, joining tables together
   becomes very expensive.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/db_joins.png
      :alt: Representation of joining tables in a SQL database 

   Recall our rule of thumb when modeling data in MongoDB: *data that is
   accessed together should be stored together*. When you follow this rule
   of thumb, most queries will not require you to join any data together.

   Continuing with our earlier example, if we want to retrieve Leslie’s
   information from MongoDB, we can simply query for a single document in
   the ``Users`` collection. As a result, our query will be very fast.

   As our documents and collections grow larger, we don’t have to worry
   about our queries slowing down as long as we are using indexes and
   continue following our rule of thumb: *data that is accessed together
   should be stored together*.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/dbnojoins.png
      :alt: Representation of a MongoDB query with no joins 

   .. _sql-mdb-2-pivot-easier:

   Pivot Easier
   ------------

   Requirements change. Sometimes the changes are simple and require only a
   few tweaks to the user interface. But sometimes changes go all the way
   down to the database.

   In the previous post in this series, we discovered—after implementing our
   application—that we needed to :ref:`store information about Lauren’s school <sql-mdb-1-store-laurens-info>`.
   Let’s take a look at this example a little more closely.

   To add a new ``school`` column in our SQL database, we’re going to have
   to alter the ``Users`` table. Executing the ``Alter Table`` command
   could take a couple of hours depending on how much data is in the table.
   The performance of our application could be decreased while the table is
   being altered, and we may need to schedule downtime for our application.

   .. image:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/altertable_parksandrec.png
      :alt: Alter Table command 

   Now let’s examine how we can do something similar in MongoDB. When our
   requirements change and we need to begin storing the name of a user’s
   school in a ``User`` document, we can simply begin doing so. We can
   choose if and when to update existing documents in the collection.

   If we had implemented schema validation, we would have the option of
   applying the validation to all inserts and updates or only to inserts
   and updates to documents that already meet the schema requirements. We
   would also have the choice of throwing an error or a warning if a
   validation rule is violated.

   With MongoDB, you can easily change the shape of your data as your app
   evolves.

      :alt: Change the shape of your data in MongoDB without executing an Alter Table command

   .. _sql-mdb-2-program-faster:

   Program Faster
   --------------

   To be honest with you, this advantage is one of the biggest surprises to
   me. I figured that it didn’t matter what you used as your backend
   database—the code that interacts with it would be basically the same. I
   was wrong.

   .. figure:: /images/article/sql-to-mdb/bensurprise.gif
      :alt: Ben looks completely shocked 

      MFW I realized how much easier it is to code with MongoDB.

   MongoDB documents map to data structures in most popular programming
   languages. This sounds like such a simple thing, but it makes a
   *humongous* difference when you’re writing code.

   A friend encouraged me to test this out, so I did. I implemented the
   code to retrieve and update user profile information. My code has some
   simplifications in it to enable me to focus on the interactions with the
   database rather than the user interface. I also limited the user profile
   information to just contact information and hobbies.

   Below is a comparison of my implementation using
   `MySQL <https://www.mysql.com>`__ and MongoDB.

   I wrote the code in Python, but, don’t worry if you’re not familiar with
   Python, I’ll walk you through it step by step. The concepts will be
   applicable no matter what your programming language of choice is.

   Connect to the Databases
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Let’s begin with the typical top-of-the-file stuff. We’ll import what we
   need, connect to the database, and declare our variables. I’m going to
   simplify things by hardcoding the User ID of the user whose profile we
   will be retrieving rather than pulling it dynamically from the frontend
   code.

   MySQL

   .. code:: python

      import mysql.connector
      
      # CONNECT TO THE DB
      mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
         host="localhost",
         user="root",
         passwd="rootroot",
         database="CityHall"
      )
      mycursor = mydb.cursor(dictionary=True)
      
      # THE ID OF THE USER WHOSE PROFILE WE WILL BE RETRIEVING AND UPDATING
      userId = 1

   We'll pass the `dictionary=True <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlcursordict.html>`_
   option when we create the cursor so that each row will be returned as a dictionary.

   MongoDB

   .. code:: python

      import pymongo
      from pymongo import MongoClient
      
      # CONNECT TO THE DB
      client = MongoClient()
      client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb+srv://root:rootroot@mycluster.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
      db = client.CityHall
      
      # THE ID OF THE USER WHOSE PROFILE WE WILL BE RETRIEVING AND UPDATING
      userId = 1

   So far, the code is pretty much the same.

   Get the User’s Profile Information
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Now that we have our database connections ready, let’s use them to
   retrieve our user profile information. We’ll store the profile
   information in a `Python
   Dictionary <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`__.
   Dictionaries are a common data structure in Python and provide an easy
   way to work with your data.

   Let’s begin by implementing the code for MySQL.

   Since the user profile information is spread across the ``Users`` table
   and the ``Hobbies`` table, we’ll need to join them in our query. We can
   use `prepared
   statements <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement>`__ to
   ensure our data stays safe.

   MySQL

   .. code:: python

      sql = "SELECT * FROM Users LEFT JOIN Hobbies ON Users.ID = Hobbies.user_id WHERE Users.id=%s"
      values = (userId,)
      my cursor.execute(sql, values)
      user = mycursor.fetchone()

   When we execute the query, a
   result is returned for every user/hobby combination. When we call ``fetchone()``, we get a dictionary
   like the following

   .. code:: python

      {u'city': u'Pawnee', u'first_name': u'Leslie', u'last_name': u'Yepp', u'user_id': 1, u'school': None, u'longitude': -86.5366, u'cell': u'8125552344', u'latitude': 39.1703, u'hobby': u'scrapbooking', u'ID': 10}

   Because we joined the ``Users`` and the ``Hobbies`` tables, we have a
   result for each hobby this user has. To retrieve all of the hobbies, we
   need to iterate the cursor. We’ll append each hobby to a new ``hobbies``
   array and then add the ``hobbies`` array to our ``user`` dictionary.

   MySQL

   .. code:: python

      hobbies = []
      if (user["hobby"]):
        hobbies.append(user["hobby"])
      del user["hobby"]
      del user["ID"]
      for result in mycursor:
        hobbies.append(result["hobby"])
      user["hobbies"] = hobbies

   Now let’s implement that same functionality for MongoDB.

   Since we stored all of the user profile information in the ``User``
   document, we don’t need to do any joins. We can simply retrieve a single
   document in our collection.

   Here is where the big advantage that *MongoDB documents map to data
   structures in most popular programming languages* comes in. I don’t have
   to do any work to get my data into an easy-to-work-with
   Python Dictionary. MongoDB gives me all of the results in a Python Dictionary
   automatically.

   MongoDB

   .. code:: python

      user = db['Users'].find_one({"_id": userId})

   And that’s it—we’re done. What took us 12 lines for MySQL, we were able
   to implement in 1 line for MongoDB.

   Our ``user`` dictionaries are now pretty similar in both pieces of code.

   MySQL

   .. code:: json

      {
         'city': 'Pawnee', 
         'first_name': 'Leslie', 
         'last_name': 'Yepp', 
         'school': None, 
         'cell': '8125552344', 
         'latitude': 39.1703,
         'longitude': -86.5366,3
         'hobbies': ['scrapbooking', 'eating waffles', 'working'],
         'user_id': 1
      }

   MongoDB

   .. code:: json

      {
         'city': 'Pawnee', 
         'first_name': 'Leslie', 
         'last_name': 'Yepp', 
         'cell': '8125552344', 
         'location': [-86.536632, 39.170344], 
         'hobbies': ['scrapbooking', 'eating waffles', 'working'],
         '_id': 1
      }

   Now that we have retrieved the user’s profile information, we’d likely
   send that information up the stack to the frontend UI code.

   Update the User’s Profile Information
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When Leslie views her profile information in our application, she may
   discover she needs to update her profile information. The frontend UI
   code would send that updated information in a Python dictionary to the
   Python files we’ve been writing.

   To simulate Leslie updating her profile information, we’ll manually
   update the Python dictionary ourselves for both MySQL and MongoDB.

   MySQL:

   .. code:: python

      user.update( {
         "city": "Washington, DC",
         "latitude": 38.897760,
         "longitude": -77.036809,
         "hobbies": ["scrapbooking", "eating waffles", "signing bills"]
         } )


   MongoDB:

   .. code:: python

      user.update( {
         "city": "Washington, DC",
         "location": [-77.036809, 38.897760],
         "hobbies": ["scrapbooking", "eating waffles", "signing bills"]
         } )

   Now that our ``user`` dictionary is updated, let’s push the updated
   information to our databases.

   Let’s begin with MySQL. First, we need to update the information that is
   stored in the ``Users`` table.

   MySQL

   .. code:: python

      sql = "UPDATE Users SET first_name=%s, last_name=%s, cell=%s, city=%s, latitude=%s, longitude=%s, school=%s WHERE (ID=%s)"
      values = (user["first_name"], user["last_name"], user["cell"], user["city"], user["latitude"], user["longitude"], user["school"], userId)
      mycursor.execute(sql, values)
      mydb.commit()

   Second, we need to update our hobbies. For simplicity, we’ll delete any
   existing hobbies in the ``Hobbies`` table for this user and then we’ll
   insert the new hobbies into the ``Hobbies`` table.

   MySQL

   .. code:: python

      sql = "DELETE FROM Hobbies WHERE user_id=%s"
      values = (userId,)
      mycursor.execute(sql, values)
      mydb.commit()
      
      if(len(user["hobbies"]) > 0):
         sql = "INSERT INTO Hobbies (user_id, hobby) VALUES (%s, %s)"
         values = []
         for hobby in user["hobbies"]:
            values.append((userId, hobby))
         mycursor.executemany(sql,values)
         mydb.commit()

   Now let’s update the user profile information in MongoDB. Since the
   user’s profile information is stored in a single document, we only have
   to do a single update. Once again we will benefit from MongoDB documents
   mapping to data structures in most popular programming languages. We can
   send our ``user`` Python dictionary when we call ``update_one()``, which
   significantly simplifies our code.

   MongoDB

   .. code:: python

      result = db['Users'].update_one({"_id": userId}, {"$set": user})

   What took us 15 lines for MySQL, we were able to implement in 1 line for
   MongoDB.

   Summary of Programming Faster
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In this example, we wrote 27 lines of code to interact with our data in MySQL and 2 lines of code to interact with our data
   in MongoDB. While fewer lines of code is not always indicative of
   better code, in this case, we can probably agree that fewer lines of
   code will likely lead to easier maintenance and fewer bugs.

   The examples above were relatively simple with small queries. Imagine
   how much bigger the difference would be for larger, more complex
   queries.

   MongoDB documents mapping to data structures in most popular programming
   languages can be a huge advantage in terms of time to write, debug, and
   maintain code.

   The code above was written in Python and leveraged the Python MongoDB
   Driver. For a complete list of all of the programming languages that
   have MongoDB drivers, visit the `MongoDB
   Manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/#drivers>`__.
