   Introduction
   ------------

   Your cheap boss doesn't want to pay for this awesome MongoDB Training you found online? In-person trainings are quite challenging given the current situation we are all facing with COVID-19. Also, is this training even up-to-date with the most recent MongoDB release?

   Who is better than MongoDB to teach you MongoDB? `MongoDB University <https://university.mongodb.com/>`__ offers free courses for beginners and more advanced MongoDB users. Our education team is dedicated to keep these courses up-to-date and build new content around our latest features.

   In this blog post, we will have a look at `these courses <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/catalog>`__ and what you can learn from each of them.

   Course Format
   -------------

   MongoDB courses are online and free. You can do them at your pace and at the most convenient time for you.

   Each course contains a certain number of chapters, and each chapter contains a few items.

   An item usually contains a five- to 10-minute video in English, focussed around one specific topic you are learning, and a little quiz or a guided lab, which are here to make sure that you understood the core concepts of that particular item.

   Learning Paths
   --------------

   `MongoDB University <https://university.mongodb.com/>`__ proposes two different learning paths to suit you best. There are also some more courses that are not in the learning paths, but you are completely free to create your own learning path and follow whichever courses you want to. These two are just general guidelines if you don't know where to start.

   - If you are a developer, you will probably want to start with the `developer path <https://university.mongodb.com/learning_paths/developer>`__.
   - If you are a DBA, you will more likely prefer the `DBA path <https://university.mongodb.com/learning_paths/dba>`__.

   Developer Path
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The developer path contains six recommended trainings, which I will describe more in detail in the next section.

   - M001: MongoDB Basics.
   - M103: Basic Cluster Administration.
   - M121: Aggregation Framework.
   - M220: MongoDB for Developers.
   - M201: MongoDB Performance.
   - M320: MongoDB Data Modeling.

   DBA Path
   ~~~~~~~~

   The DBA path contains five recommended trainings, which I will also describe in detail in the next section.

   - M001: MongoDB Basics.
   - M103: Basic Cluster Administration.
   - M201: MongoDB Performance.
   - M301: MongoDB Security.
   - M312: Diagnostics and Debugging.
