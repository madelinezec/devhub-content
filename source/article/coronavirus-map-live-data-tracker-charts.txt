Coronavirus Map and Live Data Tracker with MongoDB Charts
=========================================================

.. introduction::

   Updates
   -------

   April 21st
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   - `MongoDB Open Data COVID-19 <https://developer.mongodb.com/article/johns-hopkins-university-covid-19-data-atlas>`__ is now available on the new `MongoDB Developer Hub <https://developer.mongodb.com/>`__.
   - You can check our code samples in `our Github repository <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/open-data-covid-19>`__.
   - The JHU dataset changed again a few times. It's not really stable and it makes it complicated to build something reliable on top of this service. This is the reason why we created our more accessible version of the JHU dataset.
   - It's the same data but transformed in JSON documents and available in a readonly MongoDB Cluster we built for you.

   March 24th
   ~~~~~~~~~~
   
   - `Johns Hopkins University <https://www.jhu.edu/>`__ changed the dataset they release daily.
   - I created a `new dashboard based using the new dataset <https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-coronavirus-lwlvn/public/dashboards/5e7a3667-c25a-4c3c-8ba2-5f5d6910e339>`__.
   - My new dashboard updates **automatically every hour** as new data comes in.

   Too Long, Didn't Read
   ---------------------

   `Thomas Rueckstiess <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rueckstiess/>`__ and
   `myself <https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximebeugnet>`__ came up with two
   `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__ dashboards
   with the Coronavirus dataset.

   Here is an example of the charts we made using the Coronavirus dataset.
   More below and in the MongoDB Charts dashboards.

   Let The Data Speak
   ------------------

   We have to make decisions at work every day.

   - Should we discontinue this project?
   - Should we hire more people?
   - Can we invest more in this branch? How much?

   Leaders make decisions. Great leaders make informed decisions, based on
   facts backed by data and not just based on assumptions, feelings or
   opinions.

   The management of the Coronavirus outbreak obeys the same rules. To make
   the right decisions, we need accurate data.

   Data about the Coronavirus is relatively easy to find. The `Johns
   Hopkins University <https://www.jhu.edu/>`__ has done a terrific job at
   gathering, cleaning and curating data from various sources. They wrote
   `an excellent blog
   post <https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/>`__ which I
   encourage you to read.

   Having data is great but it can also be overwhelming. That's why data
   visualisation is also very important. Data alone doesn't speak and
   doesn't help make informed decisions.

   `Johns Hopkins University <https://www.jhu.edu/>`__ also did a great job
   on this part because they provided `this
   dashboard <https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6>`__
   to make this data more human accessible.

   This is great... But we can do even better visualisations with `MongoDB
   Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__.

   Free Your Data With MongoDB Charts
   ----------------------------------

   `Thomas Rueckstiess <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rueckstiess/>`__ and I
   imported all the data from Johns Hopkins University (and we will keep
   importing new data as they are published) into a MongoDB database. If
   you are interested by the data import, you can check my `Github
   repository <https://github.com/MaBeuLux88/coronavirus-mongodb>`__.

   Then we used this data to produce a dashboard to monitor the progression
   of the virus.

      - Here is the `Thomas's dashboard <https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-coronavirus-dashboard-yamfx/public/dashboards/4b328ffa-ba5d-435e-af11-b39fc974e47a>`__ Thomas came up with.
      - Here is the `Maxime's dashboard <https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-coronavirus-lwlvn/public/dashboards/5e7a3667-c25a-4c3c-8ba2-5f5d6910e339>`__ I came up with.

      Both are shared publicly for the greater good.

   `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__ also allows you to embed easily charts within a website... or a blog post.

   Here are a few of the graphs I was able to import in here with just two clicks.

   As you can see, `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__ is really powerful and super easy to embed.

   Participation
   -------------

   If you have a source of data that provides different or more accurate
   data about this virus. Please let me know on Twitter `@MBeugnet <https://twitter.com/mbeugnet>`__ or
   in the `MongoDB community website <https://community.mongodb.com/>`__.
   I will do my best to update this data and provide more charts.

   .. blockquote::

      Try `MongoDB Charts on MongoDB
      Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__ now. Use the Atlas
      code **MAXIME200** to get $200 and try advanced features like the
