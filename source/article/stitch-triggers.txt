   Stitch Triggers are powerful tools letting you run functions
   automatically when some change happens in your database or when a
   particular authentication event occurs. There is, though, another
   workflow where you may want to run functions automatically - at
   particular times of the day and regularly. This workflow applies to, for
   example, an evening consolidation run, an early morning validation, an
   afternoon report, or pulling fresh data regularly from an API. Now, a
   new breed of Stitch Trigger is answering that need. Say hello to the
   `Scheduled Stitch
   Trigger <http://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/triggers/scheduled-triggers>`__.

   The Scheduled Stitch Trigger can be set to trigger on a flexible
   interval across minutes, hours, days or weeks. If you have more complex
   scheduling in mind, there's an advanced option which uses `CRON style
   syntax <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/triggers/cron-expressions>`__ to
   give flexible yet precise repetition options.

   When the Trigger fires, it calls a serverless `Stitch
   Function <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/functions/>`__. Stitch
   Functions run in a MongoDB Atlas aware context and let you seamlessly
   interact with MongoDB and other configured services. Functions are
   written in standard JavaScript and can run up to 60 seconds (with the
   ability to call services like AWS Lambda or Step Functions for longer
   runtimes). That's basically everything you need to work with your data
   and services.

   And if you want to see how quick it is to set a scheduled trigger and
   function up, check out this video where we do just that:
