=================================
The MongoDB Atlas Sample Datasets
=================================


.. introduction:: 

   Did you know that MongoDB Atlas provides a complete set of example data
   to help you learn faster? The `Load Sample Data <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/>`__
   feature enables you to load eight datasets into your database to 
   explore. You can use this with the MongoDB Atlas M0 "free tier" to try 
   out MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB's features. The sample data helps you 
   tryout features such as indexing, querying including geospatial, 
   aggregations as well as using MongoDB Tooling such as MongoDB 
   Charts or MongoDB Compass. 
   
   In the rest of this post, we'll explore why it was created, how to 
   firstly load the sample data and then we'll outline what the datasets 
   contain.

   .. _atlas-sample-data-why-created:

   Why did we create the sample data set ?
   ---------------------------------------

   Before diving into how we load the sample data, it's worth highlighting
   why we built the feature in the first place. We built this feature 
   because often people would create a new empty Atlas cluster and they'd
   then have to wait until they wrote their application or imported data
   into it before they were able to learn and explore the platform. Atlas's
   Sample Data was the solution, it removes this roadblock and quickly 
   allows you to get a feel for how MongoDB works with different types of
   data.

   .. _atlas-sample-data-loading:

   Loading the Sample Data Set into your Atlas Cluster
   ---------------------------------------------------

   Loading the Sample Data requires an existing Atlas cluster and 
   `three steps <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/>`__.
   
   - In your left navigation pane in Atlas, click Clusters, then 
     choose which cluster you want to load the data into. 
   
   - For that cluster, click the Ellipsis (...) button.
   
   .. figure:: /images/article/atlas-sample-data/load_sample_data_step_1.png
      :alt: Selecting the additional options (...) for your Atlas cluster
      :align: center

   - Then click the button "Load Sample Dataset".

   .. figure:: /images/article/atlas-sample-data/load_sample_data_step_2.png
      :alt: Selecting the option "Load Sample Dataset"
      :align: center

   - Click the correspondingly named button "Load Sample Dataset".

   .. figure:: /images/article/atlas-sample-data/load_sample_data_step_3.png
      :alt: Click the button "Load Sample Dataset"
      :align: center

   This process will take a few minutes to complete so let's look at 
   exactly what kind of data we're going to load. Once the process is
   completed you should see a banner on your Atlas cluster similar to this image
   below.

   .. figure:: /images/article/atlas-sample-data/load_sample_data_step_4.png
      :alt: The Atlas Sample Data loading process will show this banner if successful.

   .. _atlas-sample-data-deeper-dive:

   A deeper dive into the Atlas Sample Data
   ----------------------------------------

   The Atlas Sample Datasets comprise of eight databases and their 
   associated collections. Each individual dataset is documented to
   illustrate the schema, the collections, the indexes and a sample
   document from each collection. 

   
   .. _atlas-sample-airbnb-listing-dataset:

   Sample AirBnB Listings Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   This dataset consists of a single collection of AirBnB reviews and listings. 
   There are indexes on the ``property type``, ``room type``, ``bed``,  
   ``name``, and on the ``location`` fields as well as on the ``_id`` of the 
   documents. 
   
   The data is a randomized subset of the original publicly available 
   AirBnB dataset. It covers several different cities around the world. This 
   dataset is used extensively in `MongoDB University courses <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/catalog>`__.

   You can find more details on the `Sample AirBnB Documentation page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/sample-airbnb/>`__.


   .. _atlas-sample-analytics-listing-dataset:

   Sample Analytics Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   This dataset consists of three collections of randomly generated financial
   services data. There are no additional indexes beyond the ``_id`` index on
   each collection. The collections represent accounts, transactions, and 
   customers. 
   
   The transactions collection uses `the Bucket Pattern <https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/bucket-pattern>`__
   to hold a set of transactions for a period. It was built for `MongoDB's private training <https://www.mongodb.com/products/training/private>`__, 
   specifically for `the MongoDB for Data Analysis course <https://www.mongodb.com/products/training/instructor-led>`__.
   
   The advantages in using this pattern are a reduction in index size when 
   compared to storing each transaction in a single document. It can 
   potentially simplify queries and it provides the ability to use 
   pre-aggregated data in our documents.

   .. code-block:: json

         }
      ]
      }

   You can find more details on the `Sample Analytics Documentation page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/sample-analytics/>`__.

   .. _atlas-sample-geospatial-listing-dataset:

   Sample Geospatial Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   This dataset consists of a single collection with information on shipwrecks. 
   It has an additional index on the ``coordinates`` field (GeoJSON). This 
   index is a Geospatial 2dsphere index. This dataset was created to help 
   explore the possibility of geospatial queries within MongoDB.

   The image below was created in `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__ 
   and shows all of the shipwrecks on the eastern seaboard of North America.

      :align: center

   You can find more details on the `Sample Geospatial Documentation page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/sample-geospatial/>`__.

   .. _atlas-sample-mflix-listing-dataset:

   Sample Mflix Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This dataset consists of five collections with information on movies, 
   movie theatres, movie metadata, and user movie reviews and their ratings
   for specific movies. The data is a subset of the IMDB dataset. There are 
   three additional indexes beyond ``_id``, on the sessions collection on the 
   ``user_id`` field, on the theatres collection on the ``location.geo`` field,
   and on the users collection on the ``email`` field. You can see this dataset 
   used in this `MongoDB Charts tutorial <https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/tutorial/movie-details/movie-details-tutorial-overview/>`__.
   
   The `Atlas Search Movies site <https://www.atlassearchmovies.com/>`__ uses
   this data and `MongoDB's Atlas Search <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/>`__ 
   to provide a searchable movie catalog.

   This dataset is the basis of our `Atlas Search tutorial <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/atlas-search/tutorial/>`__.

   You can find more details on the `Sample Mflix Documentation page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/sample-mflix/>`__.

   .. _atlas-sample-restaurants-listing-dataset:

   Sample Restaurants Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This dataset consists of two collections with information on restaurants and
   neighbourhoods in New York. There are no additional indexes. This dataset is
   the basis of our `Geospatial tutorial <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/geospatial-tutorial/>`__.
   The restaurant document only contains the location and the name for a given
   restaurant.

   .. code-block:: json

      // restaurants collection document example
      {
         location: {
            type: "Point",
            coordinates: [-73.856077, 40.848447]
         },
         name: "Morris Park Bake Shop"
      }

   In order to use the collections for geographical searching, we need to add an
   index, specifically a `2dsphere index <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/2dsphere/index.html>`__.
   We can add this index and then search for all restaurants in a one kilometer
   radius of a given location with the results being sorted by those closest to
   those furtherest away. The mongo consists of a nine  code below creates the index, then add a 
   helper variable to represent 1km and our query then uses these details with the
   `$nearSphere <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/index.html>`__
   criteria to return the list of restaurants within 1km of that location.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.restaurants.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })
      var ONE_KILOMETER = 1000
      db.restaurants.find({ location: { $nearSphere: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.93414657, 40.82302903 ] }, $maxDistance: ONE_KILOMETER } } })

   You can find more details on the `Sample Restaurants Documentation page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/sample-restaurants/>`__.

   .. _atlas-sample-supply-store-listing-dataset:

   Sample Supply Store Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This dataset consists of a single collection with information on mock sales
   data for a hypothetical office supplies company. There are no additional 
   indexes. This is the second dataset used in the `MongoDB Chart tutorials <https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/tutorial/order-data/order-data-tutorial-overview/>`__.
   
   The sales collection uses `the Extended Reference pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-extended-reference-pattern>`__
   to hold both the items sold and their details as well as information on the
   customer who purchased these items. This pattern includes frequently accessed
   fields in the main document to improve performance at the cost of additional
   data duplication.

   .. code-block:: json

      // sales collection document example
      {
         "_id": {
            "$oid": "5bd761dcae323e45a93ccfe8"
         },
         "saleDate": {
            "$date": { "$numberLong": "1427144809506" }
         },

   .. _atlas-sample-training-listing-dataset:

   Sample Training Dataset
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This dataset consists of nine collections with no additional indexes. It 
   represents a selection of realistic data and is used in the `MongoDB private training courses <https://www.mongodb.com/products/training/private>`__. 
   
   It includes a number of public well known data sources such as the 
   `OpenFlights <https://openflights.org/data.html>`__, 
   `NYC's OpenData <https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>`__, 
   and `NYC's Citibike Data <https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data>`__.
   
   The routes collection uses `the Extended Reference pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-extended-reference-pattern>`__
   to hold  `OpenFlights <https://openflights.org/data.html>`__ data on airline
   routes between airports. It references airline information in the ``airline``
   sub document, which has details about the specific plane on the route. This 
   is another example of improving performance at the cost of minor data 
   duplication for fields that are likely to be frequently accessed.

   .. code-block:: json

      // routes collection document example
      {
         "_id": {
            "$oid": "56e9b39b732b6122f877fa5c"
         },
