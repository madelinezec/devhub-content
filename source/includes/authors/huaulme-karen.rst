   As a Principal Developer Advocate at MongoDB, Karen Huaulmé (pronounced “You-Old-Maid” - but with no d’s) collaborates with developers to unleash their creativity across all aspects of data and technology. Leveraging her past experience as a Solutions Architect for some of MongoDB’s most demanding customers, Karen loves to trigger that “aha” moment in the minds of developers - when they recognize a better path to simplify, enhance, and accelerate their projects in ways they never thought possible.
   Prior MongoDB, Karen spent most of her career working with video game developers as a Solutions Architect and Integration Engineer at Nvidia, Amazon and Twitch.
   In her free time, Karen embarrasses her 2 kids, spoils her dog, and feeds her addiction to adventure travel - not necessarily in that order.
