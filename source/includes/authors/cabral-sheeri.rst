   After spending almost 20 years as a database administrator for companies such as Mozilla and Salesforce, Sheeri pivoted to using her database expertise as a Product Manager at MongoDB. She is fulfilled by helping people learn the skills they need to level up their experiences. Whether it's writing, podcasting, presenting or developing software or demos, Sheeri stops at nothing to make sure information gets to the widest audience possible.
   When Sheeri isn't helping folks learn MongoDB, you can find her knitting, spinning yarn or taking long walks.
