   Hi, all! Eoin here from MongoDB. I'm a staff curriculum engineer at MongoDB. I work on online and instructor-led training products so you might have caught a course with me in MongoDB University or indeed from our Professional Services team who delivery material I write. I've co-authored a book on MongoDB (MongoDB - The Definitive Guide, 3rd Ed, O'Reilly) and I am based in Dublin, Ireland.
