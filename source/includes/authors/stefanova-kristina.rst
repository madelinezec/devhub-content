   Hello, World! I am a software engineer at MongoDB Charts and I'm based in Sydney. My main expertise is in JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB and all related web technologies. I love learning new things, building applications and making data more insightful. When I donâ€™t code I usually do one of the following things: ["yoga", "eating", "buying books that I don't have time to read"].
