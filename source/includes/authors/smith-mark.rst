   I'm a Python, Rust & Go developer with experience in a wide range of different industries. I'm known in the industry for writing terrible code and attempting to sell it as best-practice. I love teaching and helping people out with awkward problems. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me with a soldering iron in hand, building a custom mechanical keyboard.
