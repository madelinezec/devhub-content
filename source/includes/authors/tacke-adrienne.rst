   Currently a senior developer advocate for MongoDB, Adrienne Tacke is also a Filipina software engineer, international speaker, and published author of the book Coding for Kids: Python. She is also a LinkedIn Learning instructor who specializes in Cloud Development courses. Most important, perhaps, is that she spends way too much money on desserts and plays Borderlands quite a bit.
