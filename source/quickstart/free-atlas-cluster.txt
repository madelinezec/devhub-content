Getting Your Free MongoDB Atlas Cluster
=======================================

.. introduction::

   **You probably already know that MongoDB Atlas is MongoDB as a service
   in the public cloud of your choice but did you know we also offer a free
   forever cluster? In this Quick Start, we'll show you why you should get
   one and how to create one.**

   MongoDB Atlas's Free Tier clusters - which are also known as M0
   Sandboxes - are limited to only 512MB of storage but it's more than
   enough for a pet project or to learn about MongoDB with our `free
   MongoDB University <http://bit.ly/mongodbuniversity>`__ courses.
   
   The only restriction on them is that they are available in a few regions
   for each of our three cloud providers: currently there are six on AWS,
   five on Azure, and four on Google Cloud Platform.
   
   In this tutorial video, I will show you `how to create an
   account <http://bit.ly/mdb-atlas>`__. Then I'll show you how to create
   your first 3 node cluster and populate it with sample data.

   Now that you understand the basics of `MongoDB
   Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`__, you may want to explore some
   of our advanced features that are not available in the Free Tier
   clusters:

   - `Peering your MongoDB Clusters <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-vpc-peering/>`__ with your AWS, GCP or Azure machines is only available for dedicated instances (M10 at least),
   - `LDAP Authentication and Authorization <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-ldaps/>`__,
   - `AWS PrivateLink <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/billing/additional-services/#aws-privatelink>`__.

   Our new `Lucene-based Full-Text Search
   engine <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/full-text-search/>`__ is
   now available for free tier clusters directly.
   
   You are in luck because you can also try these features for free! The
   coupon code **MAXIME200** will give you $200 to try these features and
   anything else you like in `MongoDB Atlas <http://bit.ly/mdb-atlas>`__. This is enough for 3 to 4
   months of a dedicated M10 Replica Set!
   
   To redeem this coupon code, you need to click "details" in the top right
   corner (Next to the "Usage This Month" entry) to access your
   `billing <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/billing/#billing-overview>`__
   details, then click on "Billing Overview" and finally "Apply Credit".
