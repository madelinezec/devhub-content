    In case you missed it, Stitch Hosting recently became `generally
    available <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-stitch-static-hosting-is-ga-ready-for-all-of-your-web-applications>`__!
    In preparation for the big announcement, the engineering team added a
    couple of features to make Stitch hosting even better. As described in
    `an earlier
    post <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-stitch-static-hosting-is-ga-ready-for-all-of-your-web-applications>`__,
    Stitch hosting now has streamlined support for Single Page Applications.
    Stitch hosting also has enhanced drag-and-drop upload capabilities.

    Prior to general availability, you could upload files to your Stitch
    hosting directory by dragging and dropping them. The problem is that
    most websites are not a simple set of files; they are a complex set of
    files and folders. The Engineering team has implemented a feature that
    allows you to drag and drop a combination of files and folders to your
    Stitch hosting directory. It's a small change that we think will make a
    big impact on how much time you're spending uploading files. Take a look
    at this enhanced feature in the video below.

    `Head over to Stitch <http://bit.ly/Stitch_Lauren>`__ and give it a try.
    We hope you find Stitch hosting to be a drag-and-drop delight!
