   Computers can now look at a video or image and know what's going on and,
   sometimes, who's in it. Amazon Web Service Rekognition gives your
   applications the eyes it needs to label visual content. In the
   following, you can see how to use Rekognition along with MongoDB Stitch
   to supplement new content with information as it is inserted into the
   database.

   You can easily detect labels or faces in images or videos in your
   MongoDB Stitch application using the built-in AWS service. Just `add the
   AWS service <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/reference/partner-services/amazon-service/#add-an-aws-service>`__
   and use the Stitch client to execute the AWS SES request right from your
   React.js application or create a Stitch function and Trigger. In a
   recent Stitchcraft live coding session on `my Twitch
   channel <https://twitch.tv/itsaydrian>`__, I wanted to tag an image
   using `label
   detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/labels-detect-labels-image.html>`__.
   I set up a trigger that executed a function after an image was uploaded
   to my S3 bucket and its metadata was inserted into a collection.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      exports = function(changeEvent) {
        const aws = context.services.get('AWS');
        const mongodb = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
        const insertedPic = changeEvent.fullDocument;

        const args = {
          Image: {
            S3Object: {
              Bucket: insertedPic.s3.bucket,
              Name: insertedPic.s3.key
            }
          },
          MaxLabels: 10,
          MinConfidence: 75.0
        };

        return aws.rekognition()
          .DetectLabels(args)
          .then(result => {
            return mongodb
              .db('data')
              .collection('picstream')
              .updateOne({_id: insertedPic._id}, {$set: {tags: result.Labels}});
          });
      };

   With just a couple of service calls, I was able to take an image, stored
   in S3, analyse it with Rekognition, and add the tags to its document.
