   What's the Deal?
   ----------------

   You'll get up to $1,000 USD per person per event towards travel and lodging. For reimbursement, you'll need to submit documentation of your travel expenses to MongoDB after the event. Please note that the payment can take up to 2 weeks to process. If selected for this award, you will receive instructions on how to submit documentation.

   What are the event requirements?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   You should already have an event in mind you'd like to speak at. We've written down some requirements for type and size of events that qualify for this program:

   * The conference/event must be a tech industry conference of reasonable size (~500 attendees or more)
   * The conference theme must be related, in some way, to MongoDB technologies (i.e. databases, mobile development, DevOps, IT-ops, programming languages, data science, etc.)
   * The conference/event has a code of conduct the align with `MongoDB's Community Code of Conduct <https://www.mongodb.com/community-code-of-conduct>`__
   * The conference/event doesn't already provide reimbursement or compensation for travel and expenses
   * The conference/event is not hosted by MongoDB (MongoDB World, .local, etc.)
